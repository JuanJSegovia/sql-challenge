# sql-challenge
## Overview
This project involves designing a database schema for Pewlett Hackard's employee data from the 1980s and 1990s, importing data from CSV files, and performing various queries to analyze employee data. The project covers data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following key parts:

### Data Modeling:

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created based on the provided CSV files to model the relationships between the employees, departments, titles, and salaries data.
Data Engineering:
SQL scripts were written to define the table schema for six CSV files.
Data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints were specified to ensure data integrity.
The data from the CSV files was imported into the corresponding SQL tables.

### Data Analysis:

Several SQL queries were written to retrieve insights from the employee data, such as employee details, department managers, hire dates, employees in specific departments, and employee name frequency counts.
